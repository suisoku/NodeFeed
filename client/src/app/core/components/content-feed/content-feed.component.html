                        I'm wondering if anyone else out there considers their practice "intuitive running". This means
                        running without any trackers, paying attention to your body's signals and running as fast and as
                        far as you feel like. I've been doing this for years, and I've built up to doing 40-50 miles a
                        week just because I want to and not out of any sense of obligation. I'm now thinking I might
                        want to get a watch and train a little more intentionally. I'm just afraid to lose the joy and
                        simplicity of running that comes with ignoring stats altogether. Any thoughts // advice on
                        striking a balance?W
