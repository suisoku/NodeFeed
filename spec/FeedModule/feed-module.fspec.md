# Feed module

Feed module is the most important module. In there you will put the most added value and the biggest business value. So you really need to envision it thouroughly. 

My original idea (besides the core purpose) is to have a nodefeed page wich is essentially a reddit like community with some added benefits 

* Advanced bug reporting,(kinda of a glorified post) (Echelon 0: crude label system, then we will see how to transform into a more useful system    
  Idk how to do it , but you make sure to reference correctly bug without having duplicates 
* Built-in ressources system (papers, softwares) (as a sidenav thing)
* Listing feature for subproducts(sidenav thing)
* Distinguished Feedback/Idea reporting system
* Really what I want you to do is more of a github thing than a reddit ultimately , some interesting features include:
  * Sponsors and contributors (sidenav)
  * Release system
  * Link to official page
  * Labeling/flair system

And then companies can claim the page to access 2 things:

* Statistical data
* Administration tools (this is a problem) [solved]
  * Handle feature requests , bugs 
  * Publish releases 
  * Official communications etc 

The whole idea is that companies no longer need to support forums/SAV forms etc , it is taken care of by NodeFeed now (uberisation) hence the page claiming.
Because we are dealing with homogenous communities (it's all about products and business), the author will not have any special control. The rules are the same everywhere (no need of custom moderation like reddit)

## Trustpilot example

Trustpilot (2 step verification) : you can create automatically nodefeed pages (verify by name : you need to enforce this specific feature verification)
BUT in order to add a profile picture or a description it needs to be verified by a team of validators (or AI or whatever)
You can review though with no problems. 
What you can do is not fully enable all the features if a page is not claimed (bug reporting , is kinda useless if you are not claimed and you may have moderations issues too). I found the algorithm DUDE! More feautures = more responsabilities = is CLAIMED and RUNNED. Minimum features = minimum responsabilities = AUTOMATIC PAGE with low moderation from global mod team.

You can assign volunteers from a community (a al github) or contributoors to mod the space with a vote system and duration
Anyways the general idea is the regular is user is not entitled to administrate nothing, only the claiming party does. For gray areas you can have defferative systems (as explained above)

## Considerations:

    â€¢ The platform MUST be created and managed for and by the community without the need of companies (very important for scaling purposes) otherwise if you require companies you cannot scale at the beginning and you limit yourself to only community-caring corporations.

## Features:

    1. Ability to create a new page (with picture)
    2. Display posts related to that page
    3. Being able to edit a given  page
    4. Follow/unfollow that page
    5. Page has buttons for posting, filtering, display control
    6. Infinite scrolling
    7. .. For more see above
    
    Echelon 0 Features:
        1. Create a new page with minimal info 
        2. Display posts
        3. Follow/unfollow it will be displayed on homepage
        4. Infinite scrolling
    Echelon 1 features
        1. Settings pannel of a nodefeed
        2. Moderation tools of a nodefeed (Reported, Spam etc)

## Identified class of problems:

* Where to put button(s) that allows to create a nodefeed page ?
* Who has control over that page ? Is there a verification process vefore submitting a page ?
  * Serious business model  proposition
* How to identify a page ? By its domain name , name ? , special identifier ?
